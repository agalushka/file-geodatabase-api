## Issues

Find a bug or want to request a new feature?  Please let us know by submitting an issue.

##  Known Issues 
* Concurrent access from Windows and Linux clients to the same File GeoDatabase can corrupt data. This combination should be avoided.
* SQL joins are not supported.

## Fixed Issues at 1.4:
* NIM071731 Add support for Compressed Data File. (Read Only)
* NIM073951 Request to support custom spatial references with the File Geodatabase API.
* NIM082242 ENH: File Geodatabase API (v1.2) executeSQL should honor SELECT statement's nominated field list, in the returned EnumRows object, instead of all fields.
* NIM084105 MultiPartShapeBuffer::GetMs return the wrong pointer value 
* NIM085366 Using only a null or empty geometry results in a invalid extent.
* NIM085995 Using ExecuteSQL with an ORDER BY on a text field fails on MacOS
* NIM098151 Table.GetDefinition function leaks memory
* NIM098225 CloseGeodatabase hangs on 64-bit if same gdb opened more than once
* NIM098322 Getter/setter functions by name need to be optimized for sequential search across the column selection list.
* NIM099041 Some apparently valid XML feature class definitions create tables that fail on export and copy/paste.
